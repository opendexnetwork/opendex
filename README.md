**OpenDEX is a cross-chain DEX ecosystem, featuring a user-friendly webapp for traders and a high-speed network for liquidity providers built on the [Lightning](https://lightning.network/) and [Connext](https://connext.network/) networks.** OpenDEX consists of software, community, member projects, and an open protocol standard with the goal to unify currently incompatible protocols and fragmented liquidity.
