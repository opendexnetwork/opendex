# Hello!

**OpenDEX is setting a standard in a world of fragmented liquidity pools and incompatible DEX protocols with the goal to create a single global decentralized exchange network.** We refer to OpenDEX as "layer 3" because it is built on top of the layer 2 [Lightning](https://lightning.network/) and [Connext](https://connext.network/) networks. At its core, it is a set of open protocol specifications, called **BOLD**. BOLD stands for: Basis of L3 DEX. The naming is intentionally derived from [BOLT](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc), the Lightning Network specifications and role model of OpenDEX. These specifications ensure that OpenDEX nodes are compatible and users of different software implementations are able to trade with each other. **OpenDEX is not a company** or any other sort of legal entity, it is an open community of motivated individuals maintaining the BOLD specifications. OpenDEX was started because we believe there should be one DEX, not hundreds. Find the slides from the first public announcement at \#hcpp19 in Prague [here](https://github.com/opendexnetwork/opendex/tree/90dd7a7e28cebf3d9cafc3f0a2218362552c06d6/slides/20191005_hcpp19.pdf) and the video recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euSr9A6tI90).
