# Hello!

**OpenDEX is a layer 3 cross-chain DEX built on the [Lightning](https://lightning.network/) and [Connext](https://connext.network/) networks.** OpenDEX consists of software, community and an open protocol standard with the goal to unify liquidity of currently incompatible protocols and fragmented liquidity onto one network.

**OpenDEX is not a company**, nor any other sort of legal entity. It is an open community of individuals & supporting projects, working together to maintain the OpenDEX software and protocol specifications. OpenDEX was started to create a long-term viable alternative to trading on trusted and KYCed centralized exchanges. Find the slides of the first public announcement at \#hcpp19 in Prague [here](https://github.com/opendexnetwork/opendex/tree/90dd7a7e28cebf3d9cafc3f0a2218362552c06d6/slides/20191005_hcpp19.pdf) and the video recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euSr9A6tI90).
